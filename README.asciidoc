Smallest Escrow Service
=======================

This ruby sinatra web site does the minimal amount possible to execute a trade
between two parties. Its made to trade Bitcoin for USD using bitcoind and
dwolla.com to perform the transfer.

Escrow services are useful because its easier (in theory) to trust an escrow
service than a receiving party due to motivations. An escrow service is willing
to be a public entity with a verifiable identity when two parties with no
mutual history want to trade value.
